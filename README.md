# League of Help

I started playing League of Legends several months ago, and because I find the game quite difficult to master,
I watched a lot of videos and websites on Youtube to progress as fast as possible.
But I'm still bad at the game, so I'm creating a website to help noobs like [me](https://na.op.gg/summoner/userName=Vianpyro) master the game!
