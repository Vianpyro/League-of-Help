# First steps: IDE
The first step to developing anything, whether you want to contribute to League of Help or create your own website or application, is to find out which development environment you want to work with. Since these are League of Legends web features, there's really no one development environment that's better than another. It is strongly recommended to use [GitHub desktop](https://desktop.github.com/) or simply [Git](https://git-scm.com/). Our developers use [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) which is the most convenient, but also [Atom](https://atom.io/) or [Notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/) and some other unfamiliar code editors.
You can install them using the default settings they provide. Feel free to modify the look and feel to suit your needs, or install a few plugins or packages if you wish.

# Join the team!
We are recruiting!
To become a collaborator, just ask [Vianpyro](https://github.com/Vianpyro)!

# Fork the repo you want
You can fork a repository instead of just creating one, it's up to you; a fork actually creates a repository on your profile page, and is linked to the original project.
